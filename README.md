### Shrimp Jenga

## Why?

The charming podcast [Home Cooking](https://homecooking.show/) made a joke about Shrimp Jenga. As part of the joke they bought the domain shrimpjenga.com

## No, but really, why?

Seemed fun. Something I didn't know how to do

## Did you steal a lot of code for this?

I really did.

And I got the shrimp for free from: https://free3d.com/3d-models/shrimp
